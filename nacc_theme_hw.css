/* Basic usability: always underline links at rest. I know graphic designers like
to sneer and call it "visually primitive," while affecting an expression exactly
as if there was a very small turd directly under their nose, but we need to be as
accessible as possible. NA has a disproportionate number of disabled members.
It's also a real good idea to change the color dramatically. There's a reason
that most sites use blue and red. Try using a colorblind simulator. They show up.
